# üìò Math for Machine Learning ‚Äì Weekly Projects

This repository is my **learning journey into the mathematics behind machine learning**.  
Each week I take a math concept (linear algebra, calculus, probability, optimization, etc.),  
implement a small project in Python, and document how the math shows up in machine learning.

The goal: **see the math in action** by coding it from scratch, before relying on high-level libraries.

## ‚úÖ Week 1: From Vectors to Predictions ‚Äì 2D Linear Regression
- **Concepts learned:** vectors, dot product, matrix multiplication, projections  
- **Formula used:**  
  \[
  w = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y
  \]  
- **Project:** Predict house prices with 2 features (size, rooms)  
- **Tools:** NumPy only (no sklearn/statsmodels)  
- **Evaluation metric:** Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## üìÖ Planned Weeks
- **Week 2:** Gradient Descent (calculus in action)  
- **Week 3:** Probability & Bayes Theorem (Na√Øve Bayes Classifier)  
- **Week 4:** Eigenvalues & SVD (PCA from scratch)  
- **Week 5:** Regularization (L1/L2)  
- **Week 6:** Optimization techniques (SGD, Adam)
